Currently, I’m an undergraduate student from Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University. I am also an undergraduate researcher at computer vision lab at my institute. 

I’m also an AI & Deep Learning Enthusiast. I am intrigued by with its applications in Human Computer and Robot Interaction research. To pursue my interests, I have been involved in a number of projects on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP and Robotics. Apart from my research work, I also worked at different start-ups/companies gain more practical experiance.I also worked on some electronics projects as a member of team on Sensor Designing.

Well, during leisure, I like to listen music (from different countries), read books (mostly thriller ones) etc.I also like to travel and have some interest in art, design.

### My Research Interests
* Robotics
* Computer vision 
* Machine Learning and its Applications
*	Natural Language Processing
