Here are my projects with short descriptions.

### Small Model of Wirelessly Controlled Amphibian robot
> *Nov,15 – Jan,16*

It can traverse through both land and water. It is based on design of a Hovercraft. It is a Self-made project for a robotics competition with my team. I was a team-lead and part of a design team.

### A Gird Traversing Robot based on Travelling Salesman Problem
> *Jan,16 – Feb,16*

A fully autonomous robot is built to traverse a grid and pick up objects from various node points in the grid and carry those to the goal point. I also use object avoidance algorithm so, that there will not be any collision with obstacles at the nodes. It is a Self-made project for a robotics competition with my team. I was a team-lead and design the algorithm and write the code for the robot.

### An AI program for a popular game ‘CONNECT 4’
> *March,16 – March,16*

It works by recognizing pattern on game board through Image Processing and decide the best move against an opponent automatically by calculating proper utility function from those patterns. We used MINMAX algorithm for that. It is a Self-made project for a robotics competition with my team. I was a team member and design the algorithm and write the code for the AI.

### A Simulation of a Robot Arm of 6 DOF for Brain Computer Interface Simulation
> *June,16 – July,16*

It is a MATLAB based graphical interface for a 6DOF PUMA Robot arm for visualization of robot arm through a EEG Based Controller under [Dr.Pratyusha Rakhshit](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=00rPoQEAAAAJ&hl=en)  of ETCE Dept. of Jadavpur University. I have only developed the GUI of that Robot arm.

### A Low cost Diagnostic kit having EEG/ECG sensors and chest impedance analyzers
> *May,16 – Sept,16*

It is an analog circuit design project where we build a low cost EEG cum ECG sensor and a chest impedance measurement device for medical purposes. During that project, our mentor was  Prof. Nirmoy Modak of ETCE Dept. of Jadavpur University.This project is for TI Innovation Challenge. I was a team member and design the block diagram of the chest impedance measurement device and design the circuit.
