Here are my projects with short descriptions.

### Small Model of Wirelessly Controlled Amphibian robot
> *Nov,15 – Jan,16*

It can traverse through both land and water. It is based on design of a Hovercraft. It is a Self-made project for a robotics competition with my team. I was a team-lead and part of a design team.

### A Gird Traversing Robot based on Travelling Salesman Problem
> *Jan,16 – Feb,16*

A fully autonomous robot is built to traverse a grid and pick up objects from various node points in the grid and carry those to the goal point. I also use object avoidance algorithm so, that there will not be any collision with obstacles at the nodes. It is a Self-made project for a robotics competition with my team. I was a team-lead and design the algorithm and write the code for the robot.

### An AI program for a popular game ‘CONNECT 4’
> *March,16 – March,16*

It works by recognizing pattern on game board through Image Processing and decide the best move against an opponent automatically by calculating proper utility function from those patterns. We used MINMAX algorithm for that. It is a Self-made project for a robotics competition with my team. I was a team member and design the algorithm and write the code for the AI.

### A Simulation of a Robot Arm of 6 DOF for Brain Computer Interface Simulation
> *June,16 – July,16*

It is a MATLAB based graphical interface for a 6DOF PUMA Robot arm for visualization of robot arm through a EEG Based Controller under [Dr.Pratyusha Rakhshit](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=00rPoQEAAAAJ&hl=en)  of ETCE Dept. of Jadavpur University. I have only developed the GUI of that Robot arm.

### A Low cost Diagnostic kit having EEG/ECG sensors and chest impedance analyzers
> *May,16 – Sept,16*

It is an analog circuit design project where we build a low cost EEG cum ECG sensor and a chest impedance measurement device for medical purposes. During that project, our mentor was  Prof. Nirmoy Modak of ETCE Dept. of Jadavpur University.This project is for TI Innovation Challenge. I was a team member and design the block diagram of the chest impedance measurement device and design the circuit.

### Lane detection in Night Environment using Kalman Filter 
> *Dec,17 – Feb,18*

In this project, i have implemented a unsupervised method to detect lanes in the Night environment using Kalman
Filter.Here, Hough Transformation is used to detect the lane lines and Kalman filter is used to estimate the lane
lines in low intensity during Night environment

### Ship-Iceberg detection from noisy SAR images using DCNN 
> *Feb,18 – Apr,18*

This project is part of a kaggle Challenge on which we worked on Binary classification problem for Ship & Iceberg
detection from noisy SAR images using DCNN. We have used few filters to remove the noise & data augmentation
with some contextual preprocessing to get more accuracy in our problem.

### Plant Leaf Diseases Detection using Deep Stacked Model for the Mobile Application 
> *Sept,18 – Mar,19* 

This project is a part of ‘Technergize’ program with the theme "AI for Social Good" hosted by “IEEE Computer Society India Council “ in which we are
developing a deep stacking model to recognize the diseases of various plants from their leaf.
